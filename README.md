# odin-restaurant

Technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS, JS and Webpack.

This project was not difficult as I was able to understand how the basics of using webpack. I had to use bundle.js to get the modules to work and this was the first time using modules. It was quite easy to use and made my code more readable and easy to understand. This project was really fun and I am happy and excited to have learned about these new concepts and webpack. The most difficult part was getting the live preview to show on Github.
